This is a project from CS170, Introduction
to Artificial Intelligence, taught at the
University of California Riverside by Dr.
Eamonn Keogh. The assignment is to
implement the search algorithms taught in
lecture to find the optimal solution to the
puzzle. Algorithms implemented are Uniform
Cost Search and A* Search with the Manhattan
Distance and Misplaced Tile heuristics.<br/>
One tile movement is counted as one move.
